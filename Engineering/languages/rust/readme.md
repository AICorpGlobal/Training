# Rust Intensive Learning Path: From Basics to Advanced Concepts

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming experience
- Familiarity with systems programming concepts
- Understanding of memory management principles
- Recommended: Experience with C, C++, or systems languages

## Development Environment Setup
- Install Rust toolchain (rustup)
- Install Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- Set up Visual Studio Code with Rust extensions
  - rust-analyzer
  - CodeLLDB
- Install additional tools:
  - rustfmt (code formatting)
  - clippy (linting)

## Day 1: Language Fundamentals and Ownership Model

### Morning: Rust Basics and Ownership
#### Theoretical Concepts
- Rust's unique memory safety model
- Ownership principles
- Borrowing and lifetimes
- Stack vs. Heap memory management

#### Practical Exercises
```rust
// Ownership demonstration
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // Ownership transferred

    // Borrowing and references
    let len = calculate_length(&s2);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Afternoon: Data Types and Control Structures
- Primitive types
- Compound types (tuples, arrays, structs)
- Enums and pattern matching
- Error handling with `Result` and `Option`

#### Key Concepts
- Immutability by default
- Strong static typing
- No null or undefined values
- Comprehensive error handling

### Evening: Hands-on Project
- Build a simple command-line utility
- Implement basic file operations
- Practice ownership and borrowing

## Day 2: Traits, Generics, and Advanced Type System

### Morning: Traits and Generics
- Trait definition and implementation

- Trait bounds
- Associated types
- Static and dynamic dispatch

```rust
// Trait example
trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

struct NewsArticle {
    headline: String,
    author: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {}", self.headline, self.author)
    }
}
```

use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }
}
```

### Afternoon: Async/Await and Futures

- Practice safe concurrent programming

## Day 4: Systems Programming and FFI

### Morning: Low-Level Programming
- Unsafe Rust
- Raw pointers
- Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
- Calling C libraries
- Memory layout and representations

```rust
// FFI Example
use std::ffi::CString;
use std::os::raw::c_char;

#[link(name = "mylib")]
extern "C" {
    fn some_c_function(input: *const c_char);
}
```

### Afternoon: Memory Management
