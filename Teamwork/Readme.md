## How to annoy your manager, here is a comprehensive list of things you can do

- Interrupt them with a million questions you haven’t even tried to figure out on your own. Who needs documentation when you have a someone to depend, right?

- Wait until the very last minute to tell them you’ll be late on a deadline. Because surprises are fun! It was an aggressive deadline after all.

- Never document anything you’ve done. Your code is self-explanatory and documentation is nice to have, right? People can figure it out later.

- Find issues and keep them to yourself. Silence is golden, especially when it’s about bugs. Plus, you’d only get more work if you share these issues.

- Escalate all conflicts. That’s their job, after all, to solve them for you.

- Always complain but never suggest solutions. Venting is therapeutic!

- Ignore all emails and Slack messages until they ask you in person. Who needs asynchronous communication when you can just wait for them to hunt you down?

- Constantly refactor the codebase without telling anyone. It’s your masterpiece, and everyone else should adapt.

- Overpromise on every task. You’ll get it done...eventually—no need to set realistic expectations.

- Switch priorities on your own without informing anyone. You know what's best for the project, so why bother following the plan?

- Always multitask in meetings. Who needs to listen when you can just code during the meeting?

- Show up late to meetings. Time is relative, after all.

- Disregard their feedback. Your way is the best way, obviously.

### **Core Principles of High-Performance Teams**

These guiding values establish the foundation:

1. **Shared Purpose and Vision**
    
    - Teams need a compelling, clearly defined "why" to align every member's efforts. This should translate into tangible, shared goals.
    - Balance short-term deliverables with a long-term vision to sustain momentum.
    
1. **Trust and Psychological Safety**
    
    - Members feel safe to take risks, voice concerns, and share ideas without fear of judgment.
    - Foster openness through role-modeling vulnerability (leaders admitting errors) and holding everyone accountable.

1. **Autonomy with Accountability**
    
    - Allow teams the freedom to determine how to achieve goals while ensuring clear performance metrics to track progress.
    - Decisions should be decentralized yet aligned with organizational values and strategies.

1. **Equity and Inclusion**
    
    - Diverse teams are proven to perform better. Actively promote inclusion where diverse perspectives lead to richer solutions.
    - Address biases, provide equal opportunities, and give voice to all members.

1. **Focus on Continuous Improvement**
    
    - Regularly assess progress, reflect on lessons learned, and optimize processes to stay competitive.

### **Global Best Practices for Team Effectiveness**

1. **Streamlined Team Composition**
    
    - Ideal team size: 5-10 members, based on studies (like Dunbar's number or Amazon’s two-pizza rule).
    - Balance expertise diversity with role clarity to avoid redundancies or role conflicts.

1. **Crystal-Clear Communication**
    
    - **Global Perspective**: Embrace asynchronous communication for remote, multi-timezone teams, using tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Notion.
    - Standardize communication protocols (e.g., response times, documentation quality).
    - Prioritize active listening, periodic clarifications, and keeping communication jargon-free.

1. **Define Roles and Responsibilities Explicitly**
    
    - Use frameworks like RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) to ensure no gaps or overlaps.
    - Clarity builds confidence and reduces misunderstandings in cross-cultural teams.

1. **Goals Anchored by Frameworks**
    
    - Employ OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or SMART goals for transparent alignment at individual and team levels.
    - Break large goals into incremental milestones to make complex tasks manageable.

1. **Regular, Structured Feedback Loops**
    
    - Best practices include agile-style retrospectives or team health-check models to evaluate performance and tackle bottlenecks.
    - Adopt continuous performance management software (e.g., 15Five, Workday) for seamless tracking.

1. **Agility and Adaptability**
    
    - Leverage Agile or Lean methodologies, which prioritize iteration, adaptability, and focus on delivering value quickly.
    - Build buffer zones in team schedules to handle uncertainty while preserving well-being.

1. **Technology for Collaboration**
    
    - Use integrated platforms like Miro, Monday.com, or Jira to track tasks, share ideas, and monitor progress seamlessly.
    - Automate routine processes to reduce inefficiency and free up focus for innovation.

### **Practices That Amplify Team Focus and Output**

1. **Establish Laser-Focused Priorities**
    
    - Eliminate distractions by limiting the number of simultaneous goals using methodologies like Kanban or Scrum sprints.
    - Start each day, week, or sprint with alignment on priorities.
2. **Build Emotional Resilience**
    
    - Foster emotional intelligence (EI) through training in self-awareness, empathy, and effective conflict resolution.
    - Address stress proactively, offering tools like mindfulness apps, flexible working, or mental health resources.
3. **Feedback-Centric Culture**
    
    - Integrate real-time constructive feedback through 1:1s, daily standups, and performance check-ins.
    - Make praise public and criticism private, focusing on specific behaviors and their impact.
4. **Recognize and Reward Effort and Success**
    
    - Celebrate small and large wins alike, adapting rewards to what motivates team members most (e.g., monetary, public recognition, flexible hours).
    - Link rewards explicitly to team objectives to reinforce goal alignment.
5. **Continuous Learning**
    
    - Invest in upskilling and knowledge sharing (peer mentoring, cross-training, and encouraging external certifications).
    - Facilitate open "post-mortems" for projects to document lessons and turn mistakes into growth opportunities.

### **Characteristics of Laser-Focused Teams**

Building from principles and practices, successful high-performance teams exhibit these characteristics globally:

1. **Unshakable Alignment on Goals**  
    Members understand not just what to do but _why_ they’re doing it, creating intrinsic motivation.
    
2. **Relentless Discipline in Execution**  
    Tasks are pursued with a sharp focus, eliminating low-priority distractions.
    
3. **Mutual Respect Across Boundaries**  
    Especially important for global, cross-functional teams, where understanding cultural norms and differences fosters unity.
    
4. **Adaptiveness to Change**  
    Teams iterate quickly when conditions shift, maintaining productivity through Agile methodologies.

### **Actionable Example Plan**

1. **Onboarding**: Initiate every member with clarity on the team's mission, principles, and specific roles.
2. **First 30 Days**: Conduct team-building workshops and co-create short-term goals. Introduce frequent feedback cycles early to set the tone.
3. **60-90 Days**: Build team habits like bi weekly retrospectives, daily standups, and structured goal tracking. Embed a focus on celebrating both progress and outcomes.

By applying the above **principles, global best practices, and actionable behaviors**, organizations can nurture high-performing teams capable of delivering extraordinary results in any competitive landscape.
