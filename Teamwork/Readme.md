How to annoy your manager, here is a comprehensive list of things you can do

- Interrupt them with a million questions you haven’t even tried to figure out on your own. Who needs documentation when you have a someone to depend, right?

- Wait until the very last minute to tell them you’ll be late on a deadline. Because surprises are fun! It was an aggressive deadline after all.

- Never document anything you’ve done. Your code is self-explanatory and documentation is nice to have, right? People can figure it out later.

- Find issues and keep them to yourself. Silence is golden, especially when it’s about bugs. Plus, you’d only get more work if you share these issues.

- Escalate all conflicts. That’s their job, after all, to solve them for you.

- Always complain but never suggest solutions. Venting is therapeutic!

- Ignore all emails and Slack messages until they ask you in person. Who needs asynchronous communication when you can just wait for them to hunt you down?

- Constantly refactor the codebase without telling anyone. It’s your masterpiece, and everyone else should adapt.

- Overpromise on every task. You’ll get it done...eventually—no need to set realistic expectations.

- Switch priorities on your own without informing anyone. You know what's best for the project, so why bother following the plan?

- Always multitask in meetings. Who needs to listen when you can just code during the meeting?

- Show up late to meetings. Time is relative, after all.

- Disregard their feedback. Your way is the best way, obviously.
