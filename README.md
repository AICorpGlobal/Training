## Team work

    As our outcome is mostly a software I have to remind that, Software is not just made out of code, it's made out of human relationships. 
    If those relationships are dysfunctional, the software will be, too. Good code is important, but it won't compensate for broken organizational designs or communication structures. 
    And if those are broken, the code likely won't be good, anyway. Or useful.
